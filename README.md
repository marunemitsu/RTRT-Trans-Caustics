This is a reference implementation of `Rendering transparent objects with caustics using real-time ray tracing`<sup>[1]</sup> using Unreal Engine 4.25.1.
It approximates several transparency features, including reflections/refractions, volumetric absorption, rough transparency, and refractive caustics.
The results are relatively noise free and a step up over the prior raster hacks in that the model plays together into a cohesive whole, rather than being individual effects.
Should you be making use of our work, please cite our paper<sup>[1]</sup>.

Setup
---

The current implementation is based on UE4.25.1.
To use this implementation, please download the source code of Unreal Engine 4.25.1 from <https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine> in advance.

After successfully completing the step above, drag all the files in [Code](./Code) into the root directory of the downloaded source code.
You may be prompted to overwrite existing files when draging in the files.
Please select `Yes` for all files.

To get up and run the Unreal Engine, please refer to the [tutorial from EpicGames](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/README.md).

We list our hardware and software as follow:

| Unreal Engine | 4.25.1 |

Usage
---

### Enable our work in UE4

Drag a `Post Process Volume` actor to the scene and switch the property `Ray Tracing Translucency` to `Ray Tracing`.
For more details, please check this [toturial](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/RenderingAndGraphics/RayTracing/RayTracingSettings/index.html) from the Unreal Engine Documatation.

### Material Parameters

The blending mode each transparent material must be `Translucent` and the shading model must be `Default Lit`.
Furthermore, to enable the roughness, the lighting model must be `Surface Forward Shading`.

![ShadingMode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33621926/145716725-f9dc648e-4b18-41c6-adc3-cfd030e29949.png)


We introduce three material parameters into our work, which are the `absorption coefficient`, `roughness` and the `opacity`.
Additionally, the parameter `Specular` controls the Ior of the material.
How these parameters affect the results can be found in the supplementary material to the paper.

P.S. We provide a [demo project](./Demo/DemoProject) with several sample scenes which have been configured.

Future Works
---
* Move to a new shading mode and update the parameters of the root node of the material.
* Extend LLT to handle stacked transparent objects, like Barré-Brisebois et al.'s work<sup>[2]</sup>.
* Applying TAA to denoise and improve the performance.
* Design a denoiser that can supress the noise in rough transparncy, reflections, and refractive caustics.
* Making the caustics can be seen through the transparent object, similar to Ouyang and Yang's work<sup>[3]</sup>.
